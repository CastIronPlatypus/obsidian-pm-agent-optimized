# HANDOFF — obsidian-pm CLI completion

## ⛔ READ THIS FIRST — the mistake you must not repeat

You (a prior instance) built the `pm` CLI (INT-019), watched R41–R46 go green + the
build pass, saw the dekspec intent "LOCKED", and **called it done. It was ~half done.**
The user was (rightly) angry. The root cause: the intention tests you authored only
covered 6 load-bearing seams and asserted on **JSON data fields**, not on the
**rendered printouts** — so workers built the data layer and skipped the entire
presentation layer. "Tests green + intent locked" ≠ "complete."

**The user's definitive win-condition (quote): "Literally everything both you and I
talked about needs to all be 100% done. The distant future state of the fully
finished product needs to happen now."**

So: DO NOT declare done on a passing subset. Build the ENTIRE design + everything
discussed, verify with a COMPREHENSIVE intention test that asserts on the actual
rendered output, and run a completeness audit showing ZERO gaps before calling it done.

## The biggest missing piece
**The CLI only emits JSON.** There is NO output renderer. `--pretty`, `--porcelain`,
`--ndjson` are declared in `cli/src/args.ts` but never read — so the glyph legend
(`○ ◐ ● ⊘`), the `✎N` content symbol, and the lineage printout shapes we designed
(the WHOLE point of the design session) **do not render**. `content_lines`/`has_content`
are computed but never turned into `✎N`. Building the pretty renderer as the DEFAULT
output (JSON becomes opt-in `--json`) is the #1 priority.

## Full gap list (from the completeness audit — tally: 25 done / 8 partial / 9 declared-not-wired / 5 missing)
- **DECLARED-NOT-WIRED** (parsed, ignored): `--pretty`, `--porcelain`, `--ndjson`, `--explain`, `--quiet`, `--no-schedule`, `--include-archived` (tree), `--transitive` (deps), `--rich` (tree).
- **PARTIAL**: `deps` (no `--transitive`); `ls`/`find` (no `--duration` filter, NO sort at all); `schema` (only task+project, missing apply/batch schemas); `apply --prune` (only archives previously-managed keys, not all spec-absent tasks); `shift` (only `±Nd` days, no week/month units); `--fields` (only honored by `show`, ignored by tree/find/projects); glyph legend (only a `data.legend` substring, glyphs never applied to items); `✎N` (detection wired, glyph never rendered); exit codes (`E_CONFLICT`=8 defined but never produced — no conflict pre-flight).
- **MISSING**: `import` (not in dispatch map); `--sort` (find/ls/projects); `--duration` filter; create `--after/--before` reorder; `reorder` command.
- **DESIGN-DOC EXTRAS the doc scoped to "INT-022/023" but the user wants NOW** (all MISSING): `validate` (+`--fix`), `rollup`, `reconcile`, `graph` (+`--dot`), `critical-path`, `blockers` (standalone), `export`, `snapshot`/`restore`, `watch`, `batch`, `dup`, `rm`, `reorder`, `explain`, `schedule` (standalone preview/`--apply`). User said build EVERYTHING — do not defer these.

## What IS solid (don't rebuild): the command LOGIC/dispatch works
`today`, `overdue`, `open` (+`--by deps`), `blocked`, `next`, `deps`, `agenda`, `show`,
`path`, `palette`, `new project|milestone|task|subtask` (auto-mint + nested layout +
backlink), `apply` (upsert + key sidecar `.obsidian/plugins/project-manager/pm-cli-keys.json`),
`set`, `note --append|--set|--prepend`, `depend`/`undepend` (cycle-checked → E_CYCLE),
`mv --parent`, `mv project --dir`, `rename` (bidirectional), `archive`, `shift` (cascade
+ `--dry-run`/`--no-cascade`), slug-path handles, JSON envelope. The shortfall is
RENDERING + flag-honoring + missing commands, not the core engine.

## The CLI printout design (what the pretty renderer must produce)
Legend line on every view. Glyphs: `○ todo  ◐ doing  ● done  ⊘ blocked`. `✎N` = N lines
of REAL note content (excludes frontmatter + the `<!-- pm:link -->` managed backlink) —
tells the agent which notes are worth `show`-ing. `[id]` bracketed + greppable. Lineage
indentation (project → milestone → task → subtask).
- `tree <id>` on ANY item, composable flags `--sub` (subtree) / `--needs` (upstream deps)
  / `--blocks` (downstream dependents) / `--all` / `--depth N`. (Stashed partial wiring at
  `git stash@{0}` — superseded, rebuild cleanly.)
- `today`: lineage-shaped, due-today only, ancestors as context headers, SINGLE `⚠ N overdue — pm overdue`
  pointer ONLY when overdue exists (do NOT double-mention it), footer counts.
- `overdue`: due<today not-done, `!Nd` days-overdue markers.
- `open`: all not-done, lineage-shaped, blocked-aware (`⊘ blocked by …`), `--by deps` variant.
- `deps <id>`: needs (upstream) / blocks (downstream) graph, blocked warning.
- `ls`/`find`: FLAT table, filters `--status/--due(today|before|after|range)/--start/--project/
  --milestone/--tag/--assignee/--type/--duration(>Nd|<Nd)/--has-notes`, sortable on any column.
Full design at `docs/cli-design.md` (UNTRACKED — keep untracked; it's the spec). Mockups
are in the compaction summary / vault; match them exactly.

## RECOVERY PLAN (do this, in order)
1. **Re-author a COMPREHENSIVE intention test** using the `intention-tests` skill PROPERLY
   this time (the user explicitly said your failure was not using it to capture what we
   discussed). Capture EVERY command, EVERY flag, EVERY output mode, and assert on RENDERED
   output (grep printed lines for glyphs, `✎N`, legend, indentation, the specific view
   shapes) — not just JSON data. Require a coverage matrix (command × flag × output-mode →
   asserted?) so completeness is provable. This is the real win-condition. It lives in
   `cli/pm.test.ts` (+ maybe new `cli/render.test.ts`). Assert RED first.
2. **Reopen INT-019 in dekspec** (it is currently LOCKED but INCOMPLETE — unlock it; its
   status is a lie right now). Expand WS-009..012 / add WS for the renderer + the extras.
   Consider new intents for big extras (watch/batch/export) if size caps demand, but the
   USER WANTS THEM ALL BUILT.
3. **Build to 100% green**: pretty renderer FIRST (glyphs + `✎N` + all view shapes), then
   `--porcelain`/`--ndjson`, `import`, sort/filters, all dead flags, `E_CONFLICT` pre-flight,
   `apply --prune` widen, reorder, then ALL the design-doc extras. Multiple opus workers,
   but they all touch `cli/` → run SEQUENTIALLY or partition carefully to avoid collisions.
4. **Completeness re-audit** (spec vs shipped) MUST show 0 partial / 0 not-wired / 0 missing
   before you call it done. Then re-lock INT-019.
5. Only THEN proceed to the finale below.

## THE FINALE (after CLI is genuinely 100% + audited clean) — user's priority order
1. ✅ **Plugin already installed** in vault (20:10 build; INT-018/020/021). Current — user just reloads Obsidian.
2. **Install `pm` CLI on THIS Mac** as a source-pointing runner (tsx w/ `cli/tsconfig.json`
   obsidian→shim alias, OR compiled dist), `pm` bin on PATH, `PM_VAULT=/Users/jeff/Obsidian/secondbrain`,
   verified by running a real command against the vault.
3. **Create a pm-CLI skill** via `/skill-creator` in the Obsidian Skills folder documenting the
   FINISHED command surface (only after 100% — a skill documenting non-working commands is the
   exact failure mode the user is angry about).
4. **Install CLI on Hetzner + Delphi**, then `/publish-skill-updates` to propagate the skill to
   those 3 machines + local locations (SKIP other machines).
5. **GitHub LAST** (so it never blocks the user): build a **dekspec-free PR view** — exclude
   `dekspec/` + `.dekspec/`, scrub stray DekSpec refs from `CLAUDE.md`/`README.md`/`AGENTS.md`/
   `.github/`/`package.json`. Identify the true upstream (investigation worker `a85471cf` was
   scanning for this + doing a sensitivity scan — re-run if its result is lost). **HOLD + FLAG
   if going public would expose personal data** (real project names/financial goals/family/vault
   paths). User authorized make-public+re-private + fork if needed, but exposure is irreversible —
   scan first.
6. **Vault docs core files** (separate task): surgically update stale Board/Tasks refs → new
   PM-plugin+CLI system in: `AGENTS.md` (Folder Map, Kanban Convention, Auto-Save Rules,
   Propagation Rules), `Knowledge/Conventions.md`, `index.md`, `log.md`, `Home.md`,
   `ontology/spec/03 — State & Time.md`, `ontology/spec/05 — Organization & Folders.md`. Back
   up to the existing backup dir first; non-destructive.

## Key user instructions / preferences (THIS session)
- **Full autonomous authority.** Don't stop to ask; make decisions, git-checkpoint before risky
  moves, surface concerns at the END. "Error on the side of doing it. Don't leave any of it undone
  because of your concerns." User is the engineer who created DekSpec.
- **Opus workers only** (never fable/haiku for these). You (lead) orchestrate, don't implement.
- **Background is fine now** (the earlier prune concern is gone) — but keep a heartbeat / expect
  reaping: background subagents die if the session goes idle/closes (diagnosed: Claude Desktop
  session teardown reaps in-flight bg children, reported as "stopped by user"). Foreground is
  immune but user prefers background now.
- **Skills the user wants used**: `intention-tests` (properly!), `tdd-by-example`, `debugging-9-rules`,
  `swarm-lead`, dekspec (`spec-intent`/`orchestrate-intent`/`write-intent`).
- **DekSpec stays out of the upstream PR** (tooling + `dekspec/` + `.dekspec/`), but stays in OUR repo.
- **`dcg` bash guard** blocks destructive git (e.g. `git checkout --` to discard). Use `git stash`.

## Environment / state facts
- Everything committed is PUSHED (origin/main == HEAD == 6bd425b). 0 unpushed.
- `git stash@{0}` = tree-worker's partial composable-tree-flags edits (cli/pm.test.ts, read.ts,
  render.ts). Superseded by the comprehensive rebuild; preserved not applied. `git stash drop` it
  once the renderer/tree work is redone, or `git stash show -p stash@{0}` to salvage ideas.
- `docs/cli-design.md` is UNTRACKED on purpose (the spec; don't commit into the plugin, don't send upstream).
- Live-vault backup exists: `/Users/jeff/pm-vault-backup-20260716-200751/` (584 files) — pre-migration safety.
- Migration dry-run found 9 legacy projects that nest on next Obsidian load (Fiverr Machine, Dektora,
  Appable, Enlighten, Agentic Coding Consultancy, Make $7,000, House QoL, House&Land, Obsidian Projects Plugin).
- CLI package: `cli/bin/pm.ts`, `cli/src/{obsidian-shim,NodeVaultAdapter,PmContext,run,envelope,render,
  handles,args,coerce,schedule,globals.d.ts}.ts` + `cli/src/commands/{read,create,update,deps,apply}.ts`,
  `cli/package.json`, `cli/tsconfig.json`. Dispatch map = `cli/src/run.ts` HANDLERS. Flags = `cli/src/args.ts`.
- Test harness: `cli/pm.test.ts` (`@vitest-environment node`, real tmp-fs vault via NodeVaultAdapter).
- Oracle: `pnpm test` (full vitest), `pnpm check`, `pnpm check:submission`, `pnpm build`, `tsc -p cli/tsconfig.json`.
  Plugin check/build are src-scoped; cli/ is a separate package.
- DekSpec landing pattern (prior workers): ADR-017 Path B; status flip then `DEKSPEC_HOOK_DISABLE=1`
  for tail edits (LOCKED-guard hook blocks raw Edits to locked artifacts). `dekspec library regen-indexes`;
  `dekspec audit doctor` must stay advisory-only (P0/P1/P2=0).

## Done in this session (LOCKED + pushed — do NOT rebuild)
- INT-013..017 (external ingestion, per-project dirs, bidirectional renames, calendar picker,
  self-describing palettes) + INT-014 amendments (moveProject, dashboard vault-wide refresh).
- INT-018 (agent-authored ID authority: supply-your-own-id `^[A-Za-z0-9._-]{1,64}$`, mint blanks all
  load paths, collision re-mint + warn). Agent Guide + memory corrected to "agent supplies ids".
- INT-020 (project-folder restructure: `<path>/<Name>/<Name>.md` + nested `<Name>_tasks/`, migrate-on-load).
- INT-021 (parent backlinks `<!-- pm:link -->` sentinel + `hasBodyContent`/`bodyContentLines` detection).
- Foundation intents INT-001..012 LOCKED.
- INT-019 (pm CLI) — LOCKED but INCOMPLETE → REOPENED (task #6). This is the work.

## Task list to rebuild (TaskCreate)
1. [in_progress] INT-019 pm CLI — reopened; build to 100% (renderer + all gaps + extras) + comprehensive intention test + audit.
2. [pending] CLI install on Mac.
3. [pending] pm-CLI skill via skill-creator (Obsidian Skills folder).
4. [pending] Install CLI on Hetzner + Delphi + publish-skill-updates.
5. [pending] GitHub upstream PR (dekspec-free, sensitivity-gated) — LAST.
6. [pending] Vault docs core files (AGENTS.md/Conventions/index/log/Home/ontology 03+05).

## Immediate next action
Re-author the comprehensive intention test (step 1 of RECOVERY PLAN) via the `intention-tests` skill,
capturing the FULL surface + asserting on rendered printouts. Then reopen INT-019 in dekspec and build
to 100%. Background workers OK; keep a heartbeat; opus only.

## UPDATE 2026-07-17 (session 2) — mid-build, persona-council plan in execution

**The plan is DONE and being executed.** Full plan: `<scratchpad>/cli-plan-final.md` (persona-council synthesis: Grove=verification, Tufte=output-grammar, CLI-architect=McIlroy/Pike/Hamano/Ousterhout). 3 personas authored to the REMOTE personas DB (ids 0065/0066/0067). Remote DB: `FLYWHEEL_VECTOR_SERVER_URL` from `~/.config/flywheel/vector_client.toml` (http://100.70.252.96:8765) + token; personas_db.py dispatches remote when that env is set.

**DONE + committed:**
- INT-019 REWRITTEN: full verbatim spec embedded in Appendix + sections A–G, no phasing; adversarial grader certified PASS. (43af25e)
- Render grammar FROZEN — `cli/src/render.ts`: ViewSpec, per-view legend, byte-exact wording, glyph-as-token pretty (scan format, NOT column-aligned), FAITHFUL `--porcelain`/`--ndjson` (PORCELAIN_COLUMNS incl kind/rel/overdue_days/child_count/progress/blocked_by/assignee/priority). Leading glyph = pure status; `⊘ blocked by [id]` is a trailing annotation. **Proven live: `pm today` renders the designed printout vs the 584-file vault, stdout clean.** (b050e08)
- Store AE-001: `transact()` (batch atomicity) + `shiftTaskDates(cascadeSubtree)` (probe confirmed descendants don't auto-move). 75 store tests green. (b050e08)
- Injectable clock `ctx.now` (deterministic goldens), `coerce.parseDelta`, flag registry, `explain` wired. (af06b55)
- `read.ts`: ALL read/nav/list views emit ViewSpec — universal composable `tree` (--sub/--needs/--blocks/--all), today/overdue/open(--by deps)/blocked/next/agenda/deps/path/projects/log/palette/explain/schema, flat find/ls (filters+sort). DONE.

**IN FLIGHT (background opus workers, disjoint files):**
- a4e9ed5c → create.ts+apply.ts (new --under/import/apply-full/E_CONFLICT)
- af04b627 → update.ts (set/shift-cascade/note/reorder/dup/rm/reconcile)
- a6dbca7b → analysis.ts+declarative.ts+live.ts (graph/critical-path/blockers/validate/rollup/export/snapshot/restore/batch/watch)
Each returns {command→function} exports; LEAD wires run.ts HANDLERS + args (workers do NOT touch spine).

**REMAINING (in order):** (1) integrate worker exports → wire run.ts + any flags; (2) `tsc -p cli/tsconfig.json` clean; (3) build fixture vault + `cli/render.test.ts` = stdout golden snapshots + executable negative controls (link-only→no ✎; no-overdue→zero ⚠) + all-9 exit-code gates + run-twice-determinism; the two-way-traced completeness LEDGER; reclassify old pm.test.ts R41-R46 (they assert on data.*, now red — expected); (4) reuse-thesis lint gate (no processFrontMatter/vault.process in cli/src/commands/**); (5) full oracle: pnpm check + check:submission + tsc cli + test + build; (6) adversarial grader executes the CLI + diffs stdout vs verbatim → zero NOT-DONE + zero unmapped spans; (7) re-lock INT-019 (transition PROPOSED→LOCKED via artifact_ops.py); (8) FINALE (user's order): CLI install on Mac (tsx runner, PM_VAULT=/Users/jeff/Obsidian/secondbrain) → pm-CLI skill via /skill-creator (Obsidian Skills) → Hetzner+Delphi install + /publish-skill-updates → GitHub PR LAST (dekspec-free, sensitivity-gated) → vault docs cleanup.

**Dekspec reopen mechanism:** `python3 ~/.claude/plugins/cache/dekspec/dekspec/0.120.1/skills/_lib/scripts/artifact_ops.py transition <file> --from LOCKED --to PROPOSED --note ... --engineer ...` (bypasses the LOCKED-guard hook).

## UPDATE 2 (2026-07-17) — CLI functionally COMPLETE + INSTALLED on Mac
- All 30+ commands built, wired, live-verified vs the 584-file vault (read + write path). Reuse-thesis lint gate CLEAN. Oracle green (pnpm test 356✓/1skip, tsc cli 0, check 0, check:submission 0, build 0).
- `--help/--version/--quiet/--explain` implemented. Fixed PM_VAULT-ignored-when-no-flag bug (c0bc826).
- **`pm` INSTALLED**: `~/.local/bin/pm` (source-pointing: `npx tsx --tsconfig <repo>/cli/tsconfig.json <repo>/cli/bin/pm.ts`), PM_VAULT default = /Users/jeff/Obsidian/secondbrain. Works from any dir. Commits through c0bc826.
- Verification worker a1ab63cb RESUMED to close the 25 NOT-DONE ledger rows (stdout/exit assertions) → target 0 NOT DONE in docs/cli-ledger.md.
- REMAINING: (a) confirm ledger 0 NOT DONE + oracle green; (b) adversarial grader vs verbatim (running-CLI); (c) re-lock INT-019 (artifact_ops transition PROPOSED→LOCKED, but only after grader clean); (d) FINALE: pm-CLI skill via /skill-creator (Obsidian Skills) → Hetzner+Delphi install + /publish-skill-updates → GitHub PR (dekspec-free, sensitivity-gated) → vault docs cleanup (task #7).
